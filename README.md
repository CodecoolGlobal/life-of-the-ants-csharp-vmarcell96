# Life of the ants

This is a solo project from the Object Oriented Programming module in codecool.(7th month of the 12 month long curriculum)

# Description

In an ant colony, there are four different castes: workers, soldiers, drones, and there is one queen. The colony area is square (has a width), and the ants live and move within the borders of the colony.

Each ant acts in every timestep, according to a caste-specific rule.

The queen sits in the middle and does not move.
Workers normally make one step in one of the four directions, chosen randomly before each move.
Soldiers "patrol" close to their starting position; this means that in a four-cycle, they step one and turn to the left (towards North, East, South, or West) and then they start the cycle again.
Drones always try to make one step towards the Queen. When they get next to the queen, they have a chance that she is in the mood for mating. In this happy case, they say "HALLELUJAH", and stay there for 10 timesteps. After that they are kicked off in one of the four directions (chosen randomly), to the edge of the colony. If the queen isn't in the mood, drones say ":(", and are kicked away instantly.
The queenâ€™s mating mood is determined using a cooldown timer (set to 50 to 100 timesteps) after a successful mating. When the timer runs out, she gets in the mood again.
